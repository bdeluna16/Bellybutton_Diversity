# Belly Button Diversity
## Overview of Project
Roza is a biological researcher that is testing a hypothesis that the human naval contains bacteria that could potentially be used in creating synthetic beef. 

She has collected data from numerous volunteers and needs a way to visualize that data.

Roza has tasked us with building an interactive dashboard that can show all of the data collected from each volunteer.

Please see link below to dashboard.
